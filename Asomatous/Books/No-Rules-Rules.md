#No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention

###Thesis:
Talent density, radical candor helps push decision making to lower levels.

### Comments of note:
Everything centers around the idea that having talented individuals lessen the beaurocratic guardrails that you have to surround the organization to keep others from making dumb mistakes. You have greater trust because they're smart/talented individuals so it is easy for management to lessen their grip of control.

Candor is tagged on. Not much is elaborated on.

The term "creative mavericks" stood out to me. 

###Thoughts:

It is hard to say what "talent" is. The book suggests it is high-performing individual. With software, that is particularly hard to define. Code that is very maintainable? Code that is "clean"?
